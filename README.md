The goal of the project "Legal Document 
Analysis and Summarization" which enhances 
the terms and conditions contracts and legal documents. 
With help of deep learning and processing of natural 
language(NLP), the project offers a thorough and 
comprehensible summary of legal texts. enhance the 
area by automating the summarizing procedure and
improving accessibility for legal text. The paper 
examines how AI has transformed the analysis of legal 
documents, an area which is traditionally characterized 
by routine and time intensive processes. We examine 
how these technologies enhance the efficiency, accuracy, 
and comprehensiveness of the review and interpretation 
of legal documents, we the help of advance AI including 
NLP and ML. Contract analysis, legal research, and 
predictive analyses are the some of key applications 
covered. The benefits of AI driven analysis in terms of 
speed and consistency, as the challenges that are posed 
by data protection issues, ethics considerations or need
for humans to monitor it, are highlighted. Through case 
studies and practical implementations, this paper 
demonstrates the potential for AI to revolutionize the 
legal field by reducing costs, minimizing errors, and 
enabling legal professionals to focuses on more 
strategic, high-value tasks.
